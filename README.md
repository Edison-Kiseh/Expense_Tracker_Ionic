This is an expense tracker application created using Ionic which is a web development framework for creating cross platform hybrid applications.

Each user can use this app to track their expenses, and these are also displayed visually, thanks to a pie chart on the home page that helps displays these dynamically. 

It isn't anything professional, as it is has been developped as a school project.

The content of the user is stored and read from a file in the JSON format.
